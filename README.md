# INWX_DomRobot
This is an (yet incomplete) implementation of the DomRobot API as used by (amongst others) INWX in C# for .NET.
I wrote this to automate my process of generating wildcard certificates with Let's Encrypt, which demanded a DNS Record to be created.

It works for DNS CRUD, but I don't know much about the other sub APIs that are present, e.g. Accounting. That is why I assume, that it will stay unfinished, but working for the impemented part.
